This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

Hi, my name is Lucas Shtainer. My first language was p5.js, a form of simplified JavaScript. I learned this language was Ms. Depero, and I am extremely excited to continue my journey in Computer Science. I like to play video games, my favorite being Spider-Man Web of Shadows, an old Xbox 360 game where venom takes over NYC, and you have to fight and save the city. I've also played hockey for most of my life, starting at the early age of 4.
